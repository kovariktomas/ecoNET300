## Overview
ecoNET300 Home Assistant is a custom integration for ecoNET300 devices. 

It works locally, which means it connects directly to your local device using local IP address. It doesn't forward commands/requests through econet24.com. It uses rest api exposed by ecoNET300 device.

This integration is available from the Lovelace frontend without the need to configure the devices in the file configuration.yaml

Integration tested with ecoMAX controller ecoMAX810P-L TOUCH manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

Integration also reformatted and tested with PellasX sControl MK1(not TUCH!) controller manufactured by [Plum Sp. z o.o.](https://www.plum.pl/)

**Bear in mind that the project is in a very early, pre-alpha phase.**

## versions
* v0.3.3 - version is stable. Most of the work was done by @pblxpt, for which we're very thankful as the community.
* v0.3.4 - is a new dev version based on an earlier project v0.3.3. It fetched more data from the API. The SControl MK1 controller (non-touch version) does not have remote menu data in the API. Therefore, the code was rewritten according to the new data parameters. The standard regParams and sysParams remained. Data for the system control editParams was added. 


## Example
Here is an example setup showing econet300 device entities:
